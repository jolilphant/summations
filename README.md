# summations
using both while and for loops sum up all the numbers entered by user.

**WHILE:**
put code in while_summation.py
ask user for number

using a while loop, sum up all the numbers from 1 to the entered number (including the entered number).

 

for example if the user entered: 4

your response would be 10

because 1+2+3+4 = 10

**FOR:**
put code in for_summation.py
ask user for number

using a for loop, sum up all the numbers from 1 to the entered number (including the entered number).
